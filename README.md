# Uncovering the Link Between Geographic Speciation and Evolutionary Relatedness Within the Genus Anas 

The objective of this project is to examine whether sister species in the Anas genus (ducks) live in the same geographic region or in different geographic regions. Following this, what can we infer about the evolution of this genus? If sister species inhabit the same region, it suggests factors such as ecological interactions and shared environments influenced their evolution. On the other hand, if they occupy different regions, this could imply large-scale allopatric divergence, where geographic isolation played a significant role in shaping evolutionary pathways. The marker gene Cytochrome B (CytB) was used for the Anas dataset, as it is widely used in phylogenetics for vertebrates. A phylogenetic relationship will be formed, along with mapping it to a world map to show regions in which each sister species inhabits.
